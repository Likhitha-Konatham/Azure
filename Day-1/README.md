Introduction
Cloud computing enables users to access computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, and applications over the internet. Instead of maintaining physical hardware, organizations can use cloud services provided by cloud vendors.

What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on‑demand delivery of IT resources through the internet with pay‑as‑you‑go pricing. Applications like websites, mobile apps, and enterprise systems are hosted on servers so that users can access them anytime and from anywhere.

Servers and Data Centers

Server:
A server is a powerful computer that contains CPU, memory (RAM), and storage. It runs applications continuously and serves requests from multiple users at the same time.

Data Center:
A data center is a facility that houses multiple servers arranged in racks. It includes networking equipment, power supply, cooling systems, and security. Cloud providers operate large data centers across the world.

Public Cloud
In a public cloud, cloud infrastructure is owned and managed by third‑party providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. The same infrastructure is shared among multiple customers, but data and resources remain logically isolated.
Features:
No hardware maintenance
High scalability
Pay‑as‑you‑use pricing
Accessible over the internet

Examples: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Private Cloud
A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on‑premises or in a private data center.
Features:
High security and control
Suitable for sensitive data
Higher cost compared to public cloud

Example: An enterprise running its own servers

Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud combines both public and private cloud environments. Organizations use private cloud for sensitive workloads and public cloud for scalability and cost efficiency. It allows data and applications to move between private and public clouds based on requirements.

Features
Flexible architecture
Better data security
Optimized cost

Example: Sensitive customer data in private cloud and analytics workloads on public cloud

Importance of Cloud Fundamentals

Understanding cloud basics such as servers, data centers, and cloud deployment models is essential before learning Azure or any other cloud platform. These concepts help in building secure, scalable, and efficient cloud solutions.

Key Cloud Computing Concepts

Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of computing resources such as servers, operating systems, storage, or networks. It allows better utilization of physical hardware by running multiple virtual environments on a single physical machine.

Virtual Machine (VM)
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs its own operating system and applications while sharing the underlying physical hardware with other VMs.

API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that enables different software applications to communicate with each other. In cloud computing, APIs allow users to interact with cloud services programmatically.

Regions
Regions are geographical locations where cloud providers operate data centers. Each region is independent and designed to help meet data residency, compliance, and latency requirements.

Availability Zones
Availability Zones are physically separate data centers within a region. Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workloads by adding resources such as CPU, memory, or storage.

Elasticity
Elasticity is the capability to automatically scale resources up or down based on real-time demand, helping optimize cost and performance.

Agility
Agility in cloud computing means the ability to quickly provision, deploy, and modify resources and applications to respond to changing business needs.

High Availability
High Availability (HA) ensures that applications and services remain accessible with minimal downtime, typically achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms.

Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery involves strategies and processes to restore systems, applications, and data after events such as natural disasters, hardware failures, or cyberattacks.

Load Balancing
Load Balancing distributes incoming network traffic or workloads across multiple servers to improve performance, reliability, and availability.
