# Getting Started with Microsoft Azure

## Microsoft Azure Overview

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides services such as compute, storage, networking, databases, security, and monitoring. Azure allows organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications using Microsoft-managed global data centers.

## Benefits of Using Azure

* No need to maintain physical infrastructure
* Pay-as-you-go pricing model
* High scalability and flexibility
* Built-in security and compliance
* Global availability through multiple regions
* Seamless integration with Microsoft tools and services

---

## Azure Account and Free Tier

To start using Azure, an Azure account is required.

Key points:

* New users can create a free Azure account
* Free credits are provided for initial learning and practice
* Some Azure services are always free within limits
* Usage and billing can be monitored from the Azure portal

---

## Azure Portal

The Azure Portal is a web-based interface used to manage Azure services and resources. The portal serves as the central place to control all Azure operations.

---

## Azure Subscriptions

A subscription in Azure is used to manage and organize cloud resources.

Key concepts:

* Each subscription is linked to billing and usage
* Access control is applied at the subscription level
* Multiple subscriptions can exist under one account

---

## Resource Groups

Resource Groups are logical containers that hold related Azure resources.

Important points:

* All resources must belong to a resource group
* Helps organize resources by project or application
* Enables easy management, monitoring, and deletion of resources

---

## Azure Regions

Azure regions are geographical locations where Azure data centers are hosted. Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft, and it is globally distributed across multiple geographic locations known as regions. Each Azure region is a set of data centers deployed within a defined geographic area, and it is designed to provide low-latency access to Azure services for users and applications in that region.

---

## Azure Availability and Reliability

Azure is designed for high availability and fault tolerance.

Key ideas:

* Azure uses globally distributed data centers
* Resources can be deployed across regions for reliability
* Helps reduce downtime and service disruption

---

## Core Azure Services

### Compute Services

* Virtual Machines (VMs)
* Used to run applications and operating systems in the cloud

### Storage Services

* Used to store data such as files, backups, and application data
* Provides high durability and availability

### Networking Services

* Virtual Networks
* Used to securely connect Azure resources

---

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides basic cloud infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users have control over the operating system and installed software, while Azure manages the physical hardware.

**Examples:**

* Azure Virtual Machines
* Azure Virtual Network

---

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS provides a platform that allows users to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Azure manages the OS, runtime, and scaling.

**Examples:**

* Azure App Service
* Azure SQL Database

---

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS delivers ready-to-use software applications over the internet. Users only need to use the application without managing infrastructure or platforms.

**Examples:**

* Microsoft 365
* Outlook
* OneDrive

---

## Security and Access Management

* Azure provides built-in security features
* Access to resources is controlled using roles and permissions
* Helps ensure only authorized users can manage resources

---

## Monitoring and Cost Management

* Azure provides tools to monitor resource usage
* Helps track performance and cost
* Important to avoid unnecessary spending
